**************
TYPES OF GAMES
**************

Anarchy - It is a battle to the death with up to 8 players where the
goal is to accumulate the most kills.

Team Anarchy- Same as regular Anarchy but players are divided up into
two teams.  Points are scored by killing the opposing team's pilots.
	
Capture the flag - When teams are selected and the game has begun, 
each team's objective will be to capture the flag (located somewhere 
in the mine).  Once a flag is captured, the players must bring it back 
to their team's "base." A player carrying a flag can score or drop the
flag by using the button or key that he/she normally uses for firing 
missiles. These bases appear somewhere in the level, identified by the 
team's color.  So the Blue team tries to capture the flag and bring it 
to the blue goal.  If a flag -carrying player is destroyed, the flag 
will be dropped.  When a "goal" is made, the team that the scoring 
member belongs to receives a point and the flag will be regenerated 
somewhere in the level. 


***********
IN THE GAME
***********


COCKPIT VIEW
------------

To toggle the view of your cockpit on or off, press F3.  When the 
cockpit view is off, it is replaced by a status panel across the bottom
of the screen.  To get full screen view simply hit the + key at this 
point; the - key can reduce the window size to increase game speed.


REAR VIEW
---------

To look out the rear of your ship, press R.  If you hold down the R key
you will temporarily look out the rear; when you release R you will 
return to the front view.  If you want to switch indefinitely to the 
rear view, quickly tap R.


RECHARGING
----------

At specific sites within every mine there are energy centers that will
boost your ship's energy level.  Although these centers will only boost 
your ship's energy level up to 100, it is possible to achieve a maximum 
level of 200 by collecting `energy packets' that are scattered 
throughout the mines.  These energy centers have distinct gold walls 
with a sparkling energy field between them.  See "Mine Centers" section.


EXHAUSTING A WEAPON
-------------------

If you exhaust a weapon, it automatically selects the next best weapon.


YOUR SHIP AS A WEAPON
---------------------

The objects in Descent Online are "physical" objects; you can ram into
something with your ship and possibly cause a response.  For example, 
most doors can be rammed open or shot at to open, while hostage doors 
must actually be fired upon until destroyed.  You can conceivably ram 
something repeatedly to destroy it - if this happens to be a fighting
method you have been reduced to, best of luck!


*******
AUTOMAP
*******

The Automap keeps track of places you have been.  As you move through
new territory, your progress is drawn in by the Automap.  To access the
Automap, press the Tab key.  To close the Automap, press Esc or Tab.

The center object is your ship.  

The purple object is the mine's entrance.

Yellow areas are refueling stations.

In Team Anarchy and Cooperative Modes, your teammates appear as colored
objects with directional arrows.


********
POWERUPS
********

Shield Boost:
-------------
This will give your ships shield's a kick.  By getting powerups, you 
can get your shields up to the maximum limit for your ship.

Pyro/GX:
Maximum Shields= 200

Tigg/SB:
Maximum Shields= 150

Aggressor Prime:
Maximum Shields= 300

Energy Boost:
-------------
This will give your energy banks a boost.  Collect enough Energy Boosts
and you can go up to a maximum for your ship.

Pyro/GX:
Maximum Energy= 200

Tigg/SB:
Maximum Energy= 150

Aggressor Prime:
Maximum Energy= 300

Cloaking Device
---------------
Gives your ship cloaking ability for a limited time.

Invulnerability
---------------
Makes your ship invulnerable for a short time

Laser
-----
Laser cannons have four power levels.  The laser powerup will give you
the next available level.

Quad Laser
----------
This powerup will modify your existing laser system to fire four bolts
instead of the standard two.

Spreadfire Cannon
-----------------
This fires a spread of energy at your target.

Plasma Cannon
-------------
Fires bursts of supercharged plasma.

Fusion Cannon
-------------
Fires destructive blasts of energy directly from the ship's fusion 
reactor. Holding down the Fire key will continue to charge the Fusion
cannon until you release it.  Doing this can double the damage, but can
also damage your ship if you hold it too long.

Concussion Missiles
-------------------
All-purpose dumbfire rockets.  Come singly or in packs of four.

Homing Missiles
---------------
Same size warhead as concussion Missiles, these are equipped with 
tracking device that can follow a target around most turns.  Come 
singly or in packs of four.

Proximity Bombs
---------------
These bombs are dropped behind your ship, waiting to explode when 
something gets near.  Can be armed as a secondary weapon, or dropped
directly by hitting the default key "B".

Smart Missile
------------- 
When this missile detonates, it sends tracking bomblets of heated 
plasma after the surrounding targets.

Mega Missile
------------
Stand back when you fire this earthshaker.


*****
DOORS
*****

There are a variety of doors that can be found in the PTMC mines.  
They all can be opened by either bumping into them or shooting them. 
Hostage doors take several hits to destroy, and there are also doors 
that are hidden.


*******************

***************************
RECORDING AND VIEWING DEMOS
***************************

RECORDING A DEMO
----------------

Descent Online has a fully integrated demo recording and playback 
system that lets you keep a permanent record of blasting your friends
to pieces. 

Press F5 anywhere in the game to start recording; press F5 again to 
stop the recording.  When you stop a recording, you will be prompted 
to enter a file name.  

If you press Esc at this dialog box, the demo will not be save.

Note: Currently all ships will be recorded as Pyro GX's in the demo.

VIEWING A DEMO
--------------

To view a recorded demo, choose View Demo from the Descent Online Main
menu.  Highlight a demo from the Select Demo list and then press Enter
or click a controller button to open that file.  To delete a file, 
highlight the file and then press Ctrl + D.

During playback, the following keys are available:

-           Play

_           Stop

r           Single frame forward
Shift+r     Fast forward
Shift+      Fast reverse
Ctrl  +     Go to start of demo
Ctrl  +  r  Go to end of demo


The demos will record advancement from one level to the next.

Demo files are saved in the Descent Online subdirectory and have the 
file name extension of .DEM. Demo (.DEM) files may be freely 
distributed.


*****************
CAPTURING SCREENS
*****************

You can capture (take a "snapshot") of any screen in Descent Online by 
pressing the print Screen key while at that screen.  Each screen you 
capture is saved to a .PCX file in the GAMES\DESCENT ONLINE 
subdirectory.  When you press the Print Screen key, your computer's 
hard drive light will flicker momentarily to indicate that it's working
to capture the screen; you will see an onscreen message.

To view a captured screen, exit Descent Online.  Then load a paint or 
draw program and open the .PCX file you want to view.  A screen is 
saved under the file name SCREENxx.PCX (where xx = 00 or higher; e.g., 
SCREEN00.PCX, SCREEN01.PCX, SCREEN02.PCX, etc.).

To view the screenshots, you need to exit Descent Online and then 
launch a paint or draw program that is capable of reading .PCX files or
converting .PCX files into another file type that can be used by the 
program.  In some cases, the paint or draw program will automatically 
convert .PCX files into a different file type it can read.  In other 
cases, you will need to convert the .PCX file to a different file type 
before your paint or draw program can read it.  Paint or draw packages 
often come with a separate conversion program that lets you convert a 
file from one type to another.  If you need more details on viewing the
.PCX files captured in Descent Online, see your paint or draw program's
user documentation.  Look for details on reading or converting .PCX 
files.


********************
CUSTOM DETAIL LEVELS
********************

Detail levels may be individually adjusted by selecting Options (from
either the Main Menu screen or hitting F2 while playing a game), and 
then selecting Detail Levels.  Custom settings can be made by choosing 
"Custom".

Object Complexity
-----------------
This affects the number of polygons used by objects like robots, player 
ships, and other 3D objects.  Lower values will increase speed, but 
simplify the shape of many objects.

Object Detail
-------------
This determines at what distance an object changes from flat-shaded to
texture-mapped details.  Setting this slider to a lower value will 
cause other ships to be flat-shaded much closer.

Wall Detail
-----------
This option determines at what distance walls appear flat-shaded vs. 
texture-mapped.  It also affects the accuracy vs. speed of the texture 
mapper.  If you notice textures "sliding" or "jumping" a little in the 
distance, this slider is set too low.
 
Wall Render Depth
-----------------
This will change the maximum distance you can see.  Lower values will
increase the speed of Descent Online, but will cause flat-colored 
"walls" to appear in long hallways.  These boundaries do not affect 
weapons or other objects, only your visuals.

Amount of Debris
----------------
Changing this slider will determine how much debris is made when a ship  
explodes.  Setting this to a low value will make fewer pieces in heavy 
combat.

Sound Channels
--------------
In addition to visuals, sound can have a minor effect on the speed of 
your game as well.  This slider will change the maximum number of 
sounds that can be played at once.


***************
ONLINE FEATURES
***************

There are several features available to the Online player that aren't 
used in a regular one-player game.

F6 Teammate ID Display
----------------------
If enabled, this will show a teammate's name if he or she is in your 
sights.  Press F6 to toggle this feature on and off.

F7 Kill List
------------
You can turn on and off the kill list shown near the bottom of your 
screen by pressing the F7 key.  In Online Team games, this alternates 
the display between Player Kills, Team Kills, and no kill display.  
In cooperative games, the kill tally is replaced by score.

F8 Send Online Message
----------------------
To send a message to other player(s) while in the game, press F8 and 
type in your message [press Enter to send it].  If you begin the 
message with one or more characters followed by a colon (:), the 
message will be addressed only to pilots whose names match the 
characters.  For instance, if you want to send a private message to 
Scourge, you would enter "Scourge: Your time is near!".  If you entered
"S: You're dead!", the message would be sent to any players whose name 
begins with the letter "S" (e.g., Scourge, Stan, Sue, etc.).  If no 
match is found, the message will not be sent.  In Team Anarchy mode, 
addressing messages to "1:" or "2:" will send them only to Team 1 
(BLUE) or Team 2 (RED), respectively.

Shift + F9 to Shift + F12 Record Taunt Macros
---------------------------------------------
You can create pre-defined taunts for your opponents using the message 
macro keys.  To define or redefine a macro, press Shift + F9 through 
Shift + F12, type in a message, and then press Enter to save it.

F9 to F12 Send Taunt Macros
---------------------------
To send a taunt macro, press one of the F9 through F12 keys.  The 
macros are stored on a per-player basis so you only have to set them in
your first game.  

Addressing messages to specific players using the colon (:) is 
available in macros as well.


*****************
ONLINE PLAY RULES
*****************

Some special rules apply to Descent Online games:

When you fire a secondary weapon in a multiplayer game, a new powerup
of that type is created at random somewhere in the mine (this keeps the
total number of secondary weapons in the game constant).  If you see a
weapon suddenly appear in front your ship, consider yourself lucky!  
Replacement powerups are also created when the effects of an 
Invulnerability or Cloak powerup wear off.  Concussion missiles are the
only secondary weapon not replaced.  

When you bring up a menu in a Online game, the action does not stop as
it does in one-player games.  While you're viewing a menu, your ship 
remains vulnerable to attack by other players.  It's a good idea to 
find a quiet spot to hide in if you need to examine the Automap or 
reconfigure your controls.  If you are attacked while in a menu the 
menu will automatically abort so you can deal with the problem.

Weapon powerups are single-use only in Online games.  This means if 
there is only one Fusion Cannon in the mine and someone else has taken 
it, the only way to get it is to kill the person currently carrying it.  
When you kill another player, the weapons they are carrying are ejected
as powerups for you to take.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
*******************

Regardless of your computer configuration, you should have no troubles 
running Descent Online.  Just in case you do have some issues, here are
some tips.

GENERAL PROBLEMS
----------------

Q:  I have a Gateway 2000 P75.  This colors in Descent Online are 
    completely screwed up.  What do I do?

A:  Do a hard reboot of your computer and go into your Bios Setup.  
    Find the "VGA Palette Snoop" option and disable it.  This should fix
    the problem.


Q:  Descent Online runs slowly on my machine, especially in large 
    battles.  What can I do?

A:  Try putting your detail level on a lower setting.  Also try using 
    F3 and +/- to change the size of the game window.  Also, lowering 
    the number of available sound channels through the Options/Detail/
    Custom menus can help significantly in large battles.


Q:  I have a small game window and a low detail level, but Descent 
    Online still loads and runs slowly.  What can I do?

A:  Check you sound card settings by running the Descent Online Setup 
    program.  Incorrect settings can cause significant slowing.  To 
    access the Setup program, go to the ENGAGE\Descent subdirectory, 
    and double-click on "setup".


Q:  Why do the walls in my game seem to jump around in the distance?
    Why do I get a colored wall in the middle of my tunnels?

A:  This can happen when the Detail Level is set below the highest 
    setting.


Q:  Why does Descent Online lock up when I run it?

A:  It could be a sound card problems. Run the Setup program and make 
    sure your card settings are correct.  If you don't hear digital 
    sounds or music when you test them in Setup, try the Auto Detect 
    Sound Hardware option.  


Q:  Why does my computer lock up during setup when autodetecting for a
    sound card?

A:  Due to hardware conflicts, autodetecting for sound cards is a risky
    process.  If you know the brand, port address, IRQ and DMA of your 
    sound card(s), you should manually configure these items.  Lockups 
    are also common when autodetection is used but no sound cards are 
    installed.


Q:  Why don't I hear anything when I test my sound in setup?

A:  There are several possibilities.  You may have the wrong sound card
    selected.  You may have selected the incorrect port, IRO or DMA 
    settings.  The volume may be set too low in your sound drivers (or 
    the volume slider on the back of your sound card).  Hardware 
    conflicts or loose cables may also be to blame.

Q:  Why does the introduction music stop when I reach the Main menu?

A:  You probably have your Music Volume slider set too low in the 
    Options menu.  All Options settings are stored in your pilot file;
    when the game identifies your pilot name, it lowers the volume to a
    level you may have customized.


Q:  Why doesn't my joystick respond to the game?

A:  Be sure you have Joystick selected in the Options/Controls menu, 
    and make sure the joystick is calibrated.  If your joystick 
    connects to you sound card, make sure the joystick port jumper is
    enabled on the card.  Some sound cards have this disabled by 
    default.


Q:  Hey!  Why did some of my powerups disappear?

A:  Certain powerups will remove themselves from the game if they have
    been around four or five minutes.  This only happens to Concussion 
    missiles, Energy powerups and Shield powerupps dropped by a dead 
    player.


Q:  I have a Thrustmaster WCS hooked up with a joystick.  When I use 
    the stick to fly and the A and Z keys to move forward and backward,
    I start flying out of control.  Why? 
  
A:  Because these devices intercept the keyboard signals, your ship may
    fly strangely when you also hold down keyboard keys (like A and Z).
    If you keep the WCS or FLCS on your system, it's recommended that 
    you use those devices for throttle control and sliding, not the 
    keyboard.
